# Solar System

He's tuned a bit sharp (no capo) in the recording, so it's really dissonant unless you tune up a bit (~A=450hz?).

## Verse

```plaintext
           Gmaj7/B
Oh no! I am lacking
              D/A
I want what I see.
                    Gmaj7/B
You, fireball, have rolled away
           D/A
And shaded valleys.
                 Gmaj7/B
So here I am the creekbed,
                  D/A
So here I feel my way in the dark
                  Gmaj7/B
What wonder, what treasure map?
                 D/A
What breaking of day?
                    Gmaj7/B
What stream used to flow here,
                     D/A
And now what dusty decay?
```

## Chorus

                         Em9/A
Let the flash flood begin.
D/A                      Em9/A
Wash me down the canyon.
D/A                      Em9/A
Quicksand pull me in!
D/A                      Em9/A
Blow over me solar wind! La-da-da-da...
```

## Verse (Continued)

```plaintext
Gma7/B                    D/A
       You're vultures in trees.
              Gmaj7/B
I know you're out there
                   D/A
You're lanterns on lakes.
              Gmaj7/B
I know you're out there
                       D/A
You're soccer balls on knees,
                         Em9/A
And through your skirt I see,
                  D/A
Your legs gracefully,
```

## Outro

```plaintext
              Gmaj7/B
I know you're out there
                   D/A
You're swaying and pleased
              Gmaj7/B
I know you're out there
                   D/A
You're vultures in trees,
              Gmaj7/B
I know you're out there
                 D/A
Your mountainous peaks
```
