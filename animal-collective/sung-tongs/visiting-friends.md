## Lyrics

```
We were visiting friends
And saying hello
Then getting stoned
And not saying much
I think the people on TV
talk faster than us
I'm still holding the cup
Ignoring the sound
Of the ice cream truck
He was being stingy
She had visiting moods
We were visiting plants
But it was too muddy
Your shoe got stuck
I laughed a lot
The plants looked unwell
I heard a bird through the windowpane
So we rolled up your grass
On the seat of my bike
But the cop couldn't tell
He had visiting hands
We were visiting beds
And marking the difference
In the way that they smell
The light hits them different
The sheets do get cold
The windows are cracked
Or you recognize the room
The posters that wilt
And the clothes spread around
We were visiting mine

```
