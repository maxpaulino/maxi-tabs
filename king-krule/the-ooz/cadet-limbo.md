This repeats throughout the entire song.  
I believe there are moments where the bass ladders / changes, but I've only got 2 ears so I can't hear those moments that well lmao.

## Post-Vocals / Archy’s Guitar Licks

Once the lyrics have been sung, Archy picks up his guitar. Here are some, maybe all, of the licks that he plays in that rich tone. It could help to barre the 9th fret at times.

[2:32]

## Lyrics

```
Has it been this long?
Has it been this long?
Since I saw you ?
Has it been this long?

Has it been this long?
Since I've had this bump
Close to where I belong
I don't ever wanna leave this night
And has it been this long?
Wanting deep space lullabies
Well, has it been this long?
Lost paradise for one
I can't see your face
Resting where I belong
I want to cross you every day
Was I feeling love?
Spent most of my time
Orbiting your waist
And had it been this long
Since I got lost in space?
```
