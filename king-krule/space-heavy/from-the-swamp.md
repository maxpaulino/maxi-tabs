## Lyrics

```
It's informing claustrophobia
You've been waiting for the end of the line
Where did all those big bad thoughts go?
I don't know where I slept last night

At least not insomnia
I won't go to sleep for a while
You always ask, "Hey, what's wrong with ya?"
Depressed for the third time

I must forget you
To the back of my mind
Not to drown in my sorrow
Because if it's from the swamp, then-
Back it goes

I must have met you in another life
Or so it goes
If you think I'm letting you wade on through
All of the emotions I own

Then, if it's from the swamp
Then back it goes
Well, if it's from the swamp
Then back it goes
Back it goes

Back it goes

Back it goes

Back it goes
```

## Notes & Performance Tips

- **Tuning:** CGCEAD
- **Capo:**No Capo
- "The first change starts when he says “I must forget you”. He plays that progression 4 times, staying on the final chord longer the 4th time around. Then it switches back to the main progression again after he says “back it goes”. It goes back to the second progression around 2:11, which repeats 4 times again, staying on the last chord longer the 4th time, and then it switches to the end progression at 2:31 when he says “back it goes”. That plays for the rest of the song."
