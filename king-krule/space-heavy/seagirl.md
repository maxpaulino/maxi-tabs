## Lyrics

```
Take, take, take, take
Take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take...
Take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take
Take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take...
Take, take, take, take...
Water falling from my fingers (take, take, take, take...)
You stare in awe
Call me Seagirl
Painter, he is quite a thinker
Let him paint me, his Seagirl
Her underwater ecstasy
You could easily be the death of me
I swim through (take, take, take, take...)
And if I start sinking, I'm probably overthinking
Ooh-ooh, he comes to me
Ooh-ooh, stuck on his knees (take, take, take, take...)
Ooh-ooh, asking for better days
Don't turn me into wine
Something to pass the time
I know that when we're done (take, take, take, take...)
That's when I'll fall in love (take, take, take, take...)
Mmm...
Mmm...
Mmm...
Mmm... (take, take, take, take...)
Take, take, take, take...
```
