## Lyrics

```
I had not thought about it
She appears from nothing
Out the blue

I sink in full armor
The lake is oil of misery
Get ready, slurp it up

She held out her hand outspoken
I refuse to be saved
My plastic straw

My plastic straw, my plastic straw
My plastic straw, my plastic straw
My plastic straw, my plastic straw
My plastic straw, my plastic straw
My plastic straw

Very sensitive, very sensitive
Very sensitive men
Very sensitive, very sensitive
Very sensitive men
```
