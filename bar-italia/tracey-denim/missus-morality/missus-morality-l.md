[Verse 1: NINA]
I know I trip and stumble while I'm trying to be graceful
And I don't care if you think it's funny
I brush the dust off and I lift myself up
And I don't care if you think I'm lonely
When I'm alone the wall falls back into place

[Chorus: NINA]
So give up your dreams and come this way
You don't belong where you are
You don't even mean what you're trying to say
You just forgot who you are
So give up your dreams and come this way
You don't belong where you are
You don't even mean what you're trying to say
You just forgot who you are

[Verse 2: NINA]
I know you trip and stumble when you're trying to be graceful
And thеre's no way you don't think it's funny
So brush the dust off and lift yourself up
And I'll bе here ready to hold you
We carry on like if nothing took place

[Chorus 2: NINA]
So give up your dreams and come this way
You don't belong where you are
You don't even mean what you're trying to say
You just forgot who you are
So give up your dreams and come this way
You don't belong where you are
You don't even mean what you're trying to say
You just forgot who you are

[Outro: Jezmi Tarik]
I know your mind is changing
But you're a risk worth taking
You're scared but still complaining
I can't just stand here waiting
I know your mind is changing
But you're a risk worth taking
You're scared but still complaining
I can't just stand here waiting
```
