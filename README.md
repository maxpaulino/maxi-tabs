## Introduction

I started this project to keep track of all the songs I love to play on guitar. By transcribing them in a consistent, readable format and hosting them here on GitHub, I can:

- Access them from anywhere
- Share them with friends
- Receive contributions or corrections from others

This collection currently includes over **30 songs**, and it's growing regularly.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
artist-name/
album-name/
song-title.md
```

Examples:

- `king-krule/6-feet-beneath-the-moon/baby-blue.md`
- `bad-bunny/un-verano-sin-ti/yo-no-soy-celoso.md`

There’s also a `/personal/` folder for original tabs or personal progressions, and `tab-template.md` for consistent formatting.

---

## Usage

All tabs are written in standard Markdown using plaintext tab notation. You can view them directly on GitHub or clone the repo and open them in your preferred Markdown editor.

Want to log your own chord ideas or progressions? Use `chords.md` or `tab-template.md` to maintain consistency.
