## Introduction

I started this project to keep track of all the songs I love to play on guitar. By transcribing them in a consistent format and hosting them on GitHub, I can:

- Access them anywhere,
- Share them with friends,
- Receive contributions or corrections from the community.

## Folder Structure

- **Artist** folders (e.g., `king-krule`, `bad-bunny`) each contain:
  - A README with details about the artist.
  - Subfolders for albums, each with its own README and song tabs.

## Contributing

If you’d like to add new tabs or improve existing ones, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to submit changes.

## License

All original transcriptions in this repository are released under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md). However, please note that **the actual songs are copyrighted by their respective owners**. These tabs are for **educational and personal use only**.

## Disclaimer

I do not claim any ownership of the songs themselves. All music rights belong to the original composers, producers, and record labels. These transcriptions are fan-made and provided free of charge. 

Enjoy playing!
